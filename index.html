                    <p>Previous work curating in-context learning models assumes that ICL emerges from vast
                        over-parametrization or
                        the scale of multitask training. However, recent theoretical work
                        attributes ICL emergence to specific properties of training data and creates functional
                        in-context learners in small-scale, synthetic settings.

                        Inspired by these findings, we propose a Concept-aware Training (CoAT) method
                        constructing training scenarios such that it is beneficial for the LM to capture the
                        analogical reasoning concepts. We measure that data sampling of CoAT
                        consistently improves models' ICL on unseen reasoning tasks, making the in-context
                        learners trained with CoAT on only two QA datasets to perform
                        comparably to models trained on over 1600 tasks.
                        Our analyses attribute some of CoAT's empirical improvements to an enhanced ability to
                        benefit from natural concepts in demonstrations and to mitigation of models' over-reliance on
                        their learned semantic priors.

                    <p>Language models are notoriously
                        inclined to make factual errors in tasks requiring arithmetic reasoning.
                        To enable language models to circumvent this deficiency and offload critical computation to a
                        symbolic system, we create a collection of Calc-X datasets that demonstrate the appropriate use
                        of a calculator in reasoning chains.
                        We survey and unify several existing chain-of-thought datasets into a proposed novel format,
                        resulting in a standard collection of over 300,000 samples requiring arithmetic reasoning.
                        Finally, we use the new collection to train open-source calculator-assisted language models and
                        show that models trained on Calc-X almost double the accuracy of generating correct results
                        compared to baselines.
                        We make all Calc-X datasets and models <a href="https://huggingface.co/emnlp2023">publicly available</a>.

                    <p>Recent work analysing the functioning of in-context learners show that instead of learning new associations from the input,
                        models largely rely on their pre-trained knowledge, such as the sentiment of the labels.
                        We argue that the in-context learning evaluations using a random demonstrations can not disentangle models' reliance on such features,
                        as random demonstrations rarely present functional relations useful for prediction.
                        Hence, we propose to evaluate in-context learners with demonstrations sharing with predicted sample a specific, informative reasoning concept, which we extract from human explanations.
                        We find that most of the recent in-context learners can not consistently benefit from the demonstrated concepts, irrespective of the model size.
                        However, some models are more sensitive to concepts than others, such as T0 models, which can benefit from concepts in 7 of 8 evaluation scenarios.

                    <p>The traditional adaptation by continuous in-domain training weakens the model's ability to
                        generalize to other domains, making the open-ended deployment of these models prone to errors.
                        This work introduces two novel objectives, grounded in a semantic similarity of the generating
                        hypothesis to the reference. We show that (1) grounding of the training signal in semantic
                        similarity can mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of domain adaptation, while (2) in many
                        cases improving the performance on the adapted domain, (3) with negligible additions to compute
                        costs. In the broader sense, our objectives grounded in a soft token-level alignment pioneer the
                        exploration of the middle ground between the efficient but narrow exact-match token-level

                    <p>We propose a framework for measuring a scale of models' reliance on any identified spurious
                        feature and measure the size of such reliance for some previously-reported features while
                        uncovering several new ones. We assess the robustness towards a large set of known and new-found
                        prediction biases for a variety of pre-trained models and state-of-the-art debiasing methods in
                        Question Answering (QA) and compare it to a resampling baseline. We find that (i) the observed
                        OOD gains of debiasing methods can not be explained by mitigation or enlargement of the
                        addressed bias and subsequently evaluate that (ii) the biases are vastly shared among QA
                        datasets. Our findings motivate future work to refine the reports of LLMs' robustness to a level
                        of specific spurious correlations.

                        in a selection of Slavic languages: Czech, Polish, and Russian. We link a diverse set of
                        datasets and cast these into a unified instructional format through a set of transformations
                        and newly-crafted templates written purely in target languages.Using the newly-curated dataset,

                        models.
                        We find that the massive multitask training can be outperformed by single-task training in the

                    <p>Despite their outstanding performance, large language models (LLMs) suffer notorious flaws
                        related to their preference for simple, surface-level textual relations over full semantic
                        complexity of the problem. This proposal investigates a common denominator of this problem in
                        their weak ability to generalise outside of the training domain. We survey diverse research
                        directions providing estimations of model generalisation ability and find that incorporating
                        some of these measures in the training objectives leads to enhanced distributional robustness of
                        neural models. Based on these findings, we present future research directions towards enhancing

                    <p>This paper introduces Adaptor library, transposing the traditional model-centric approach
                        composed of pre-training + fine-tuning steps to objective-centric approach, composing the
                        training from applications of selected objectives. We survey research directions that can
                        benefit from enhanced objective-centric experimentation in multitask training, custom objectives
                        development, dynamic training curricula, or domain adaptation and demonstrate the practical

                    <p>This work introduces a simple regressive ensemble for evaluating machine translation quality
                        based on a set of novel and established metrics. We evaluate the ensemble using a correlation to
                        expert-based MQM scores of the WMT 2021 Metrics workshop. In both monolingual and zero-shot
                        cross-lingual settings, we show a significant performance improvement over single metrics. In
                        the cross-lingual settings, we also demonstrate that an ensemble approach is well-applicable to
                        unseen languages. Furthermore, we identify a strong reference-free baseline that consistently
                        outperforms the commonly-used BLEU and METEOR measures and significantly improves our ensemble’s

                        subword sizes matters and results in a 14% improvement on the Czech word analogy task. We also
                        show that expensive parameter optimization can be replaced by a simple n-gram coverage model
                        that consistently improves the accuracy of fastText models on the word analogy tasks by up to 3%
                        compared to the default subword sizes, and that it is within 1% accuracy of the optimal subword

                    <p>Over the three years, I have given practicals for 100+ master's students on the essentials of
                        text representations,
                        indexing methods or machine learning approaches to a full-text search.</p>
                    <div>I have also initiated the redesign of the course to a semestral competition based on an
                        easy-to-use
                        <a href="https://github.com/MIR-MU/pv211-utils">evaluation framework</a>.
                        Given the results of semestral student surveys, the competition model enhanced the students'
                        engagement and interest in the NLP topics. The competition results also allow us to reach out to
                        the best students with an offer for further research cooperation.
